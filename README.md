# 1. Diabetes Prediction Using Machine Learning and Deep Learning

## Objective
To predict whether a person has diabetes based on several medical predictor variables using various machine learning algorithms and deep learning models. The goal was to optimize the prediction accuracy through both traditional machine learning techniques and deep learning.

## Steps Involved

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Performed detailed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset's features, identify missing values, and check for correlations. 
   - Visualized data distributions, feature importance, and relationships between the features and target variable.

2. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Cleaned and prepared the data by handling missing values, scaling features, and encoding categorical variables where necessary.
   - The dataset was split into training and test sets to evaluate model performance.

3. **Machine Learning Models Implemented:**
   - **Logistic Regression**
   - **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
   - **Random Forest**
   - **Gradient Boosting**
   - **AdaBoost**
   
   After training and evaluating these models, the **Random Forest** classifier achieved the highest accuracy of 98.79%.

4. **Deep Learning Model**  
   - Built a deep learning model using a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) architecture.
   - The model consisted of several fully connected layers, using **ReLU** activations for hidden layers and **sigmoid** activation for the output layer.
   - The model was compiled using the **binary crossentropy** loss function and **Adam** optimizer.

5. **Model Evaluation**  
   - The deep learning model was trained, validated, and tested. Performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score were used to evaluate both machine learning and deep learning models.
   - Although the deep learning model was promising, the **Random Forest** classifier provided the best accuracy overall.
